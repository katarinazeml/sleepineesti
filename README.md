**Sleep in Eesti**

**Introduction**

This is a simple web store project made using Spring Boot. Our web application, SleepinEesti, offers a seamless housing booking experience across every town in Estonia. Customers can effortlessly reserve accommodations through our user-friendly platform. Additionally, users are empowered to contribute by adding their own accommodations, which are displayed on the website upon publication. Our app provides users with the convenience of accessing their booking history, viewing published accommodations, and leaving reviews for the places they've stayed in.
